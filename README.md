# OS Setup :gear:

Dual boot: **Manjaro** and **Windows 10**.  
**Windows** is for games.  
**Manjaro** is for everything else.

Setup is semi-automatic. Comes in 2 editions: home and work.  
Both share the whole installation process, but have different additional apps installed.

## Quick Start
First of all follow [Manjaro installation guide](https://github.com/edvein-rin/os-setup/wiki/Manjaro-Installation).  
Then [Windows installation guide](https://github.com/edvein-rin/os-setup/wiki/Windows#installation).  
That's all :)


## Detailed Overview...
... and the other info you can find at [wiki](https://github.com/edvein-rin/os-setup/wiki).

## TODO

1. Accounts support (not just home/work). *// Use chezmoi templates*
2. Windows automation setup.
