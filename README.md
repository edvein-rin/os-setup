# OS Setup :gear:

Dual boot: **Manjaro** and **Windows 10**.  
**Windows** is for games.  
**Manjaro** is for everything else.

Setup is semi-automatic. Configured by flags.  

## Quick Start
First of all follow [Manjaro installation guide](https://github.com/edvein-rin/os-setup/wiki/Manjaro-Installation).  
Then [Windows installation guide](https://github.com/edvein-rin/os-setup/wiki/Windows#installation).  
That's all :)
